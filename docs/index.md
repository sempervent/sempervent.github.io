# Joshua N. Grant
## Geospatial Systems Architect

Welcome to my professional portfolio and technical documentation site. I specialize in transforming theories, ideas, research, and experiments into production-scalable solutions while developing and supporting applications and data workflows on cloud infrastructure.

## Professional Focus

As a **Geospatial Systems Architect** at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I work at the intersection of geospatial data, cloud infrastructure, and scalable systems. My expertise spans:

- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS, GCP, Azure with focus on scalable data pipelines
- **Geospatial Technologies**: ArcGIS, PostGIS, GeoPandas, and modern geospatial data formats
- **Data Engineering**: Airflow, Prefect, Kafka, and real-time data processing
- **Full-Stack Development**: Python, JavaScript, React, and modern web technologies

## Current Role

I architect GeoParquet data warehouses, design decision support tools, and build raster pipelines on cloud infrastructure. My work includes delivering IoT/Kafka/TimescaleDB geospatial tracking solutions and maintaining large-scale raster databases with zonal aggregation.
