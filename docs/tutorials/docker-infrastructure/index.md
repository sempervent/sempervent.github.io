# Docker & Infrastructure Tutorials

**Objective**: Master complex infrastructure implementations through step-by-step guides. When you need to implement specific infrastructure technologies, when you want to follow proven patterns, when you need copy-paste runnable examplesâ€”these tutorials become your weapon of choice.

## Containerization & Orchestration

- **[Slimming GPU Docker Images](slim-gpu-docker-images.md)** - Optimize GPU-based containers for production
- **[Slimming TensorFlow GPU Images](slim-tf-gpu-images.md)** - Cut down TensorFlow GPU images to fighting weight
- **[TensorFlow GPU Slim Images - Repository Skeleton](slim-tf-gpu-images-skeleton.md)** - Complete production-ready example for building slim TensorFlow GPU containers

## Kubernetes & Clustering

- **[RKE2 on Raspberry Pi Farm](rke2-raspberry-pi.md)** - Set up a Raspberry Pi cluster running RKE2
- **[ZFS Tank with OS on NVMe](zfs-tank-nvme.md)** - Build enterprise-grade storage with ZFS

## Infrastructure Automation

- **[Deploy SLURM with Ansible on Raspberry Pi Cluster](ansible-slurm-raspberrypi.md)** - Build a HPC cluster with SLURM job scheduler
- **[Harbor Container Registry Setup](harbor-registry-setup.md)** - Enterprise container registry with network storage
- **[Dask with Ansible (CPU + GPU)](ansible-dask-heterogeneous.md)** - Heterogeneous distributed computing cluster
