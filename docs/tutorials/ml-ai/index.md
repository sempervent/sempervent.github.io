# Machine Learning & AI Tutorials

**Objective**: Master complex machine learning and AI implementations through step-by-step guides. When you need to implement specific ML/AI technologies, when you want to follow proven patterns, when you need copy-paste runnable examples—these tutorials become your weapon of choice.

## ML Operations

- **[MLflow API Experiments](mlflow-api-experiments.md)** - Master MLflow for experiment tracking and model management
- **[ONNX Browser Inference](onnx-browser-inference.md)** - Deploy machine learning models directly in the browser
- **[RAG with Ollama + Database](rag-ollama-db.md)** - Build intelligent data interfaces with retrieval-augmented generation
- **[MCP ↔ MLflow Toolchain](mcp-mlflow-toolchain.md)** - Data-agnostic LLM experimentation with Model Context Protocol
- **[Semantic ML Training](semantic-ml-training.md)** - Master semantic machine learning from embeddings to production
