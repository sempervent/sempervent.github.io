# Python Development Tutorials

**Objective**: Master complex Python implementations through step-by-step guides. When you need to implement specific Python technologies, when you want to follow proven patterns, when you need copy-paste runnable examplesâ€”these tutorials become your weapon of choice.

## Core Python

- **[psycopg2 to psycopg 3 Migration](psycopg2-to-psycopg3-migration.md)** - Migrate to modern PostgreSQL driver with async support
- **[Ruff Check Ignore in pyproject.toml](ruff-check-ignore-pyproject.md)** - Configure Python linting exceptions

## Web Development

- **[R Shiny Geospatial App](r-shiny-geoapp.md)** - Build and deploy interactive spatial web applications
- **[Click CLI to FastAPI Conversion](click-to-fastapi-conversion.md)** - Convert Click CLIs into FastAPI endpoints
- **[WebSocket Chat with FastAPI](websocket-chat-fastapi.md)** - Real-time chat application with WebSockets
- **[Chaos Engineering with Kubernetes and Python](chaos-engineering-k8s-python.md)** - Controlled failure injection for system resilience
