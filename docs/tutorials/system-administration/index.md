# System Administration Tutorials

**Objective**: Master complex system administration implementations through step-by-step guides. When you need to implement specific system administration technologies, when you want to follow proven patterns, when you need copy-paste runnable examplesâ€”these tutorials become your weapon of choice.

## Network & Boot Management

- **[iPXE Multi-System Booting](ipxe-multi-boot.md)** - Create network boot images for multiple systems
- **[Remote Dev with tmux & screen](remote-dev-tmux-screen.md)** - Bulletproof remote development for when the wire goes dead

## Workflow Orchestration

- **[FIFO Prefect Flow with Redis](prefect-fifo-redis.md)** - Implement FIFO greedy scheduler patterns in Prefect

## Unix Tools

- **[AWK Unix Text Processing](awk-unix-text-processing.md)** - Master AWK for parsing ls, ps aux, and system data

*These tutorials provide the complete machinery for implementing key system administration technologies and workflows. Each guide includes production-ready examples, configuration files, and best practices for enterprise deployment.*
