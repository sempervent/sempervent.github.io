# Rust Development Tutorials

**Objective**: Master complex Rust implementations through step-by-step guides. When you need to implement specific Rust technologies, when you want to follow proven patterns, when you need copy-paste runnable examplesâ€”these tutorials become your weapon of choice.

## Systems Programming

- **[Rust + CSR (Parse & Build from Parquet/DB)](rust-csr-parquet-db.md)** - Master sparse matrix operations in Rust
- **[Event-Sourcing in Rust](rust-event-sourcing.md)** - High-performance event-sourcing engine with async streams

---

*These tutorials provide the complete machinery for implementing key Rust technologies and workflows. Each guide includes production-ready examples, configuration files, and best practices for enterprise deployment.*
