# Operations & Monitoring Best Practices

**Objective**: Master senior-level operations and monitoring patterns for production systems. When you need to build robust, scalable operational systems, when you want to follow proven methodologies, when you need enterprise-grade patternsâ€”these best practices become your weapon of choice.

## Performance & Reliability

- **[Performance Monitoring](performance-monitoring.md)** - Ensuring application and infrastructure health

## Logging & Observability

- **[Structured Logging & Observability](logging-observability.md)** - Making logs actionable, queryable, and production-ready
- **[Grafana](grafana.md)** - Up-to-date guidance on dashboards, plugins, security, performance, and scaling

## Testing & Quality

- **[Testing Best Practices](testing-best-practices.md)** - Comprehensive strategies for reliable software

## Security

- **[Secrets & Configuration Management](secrets-config.md)** - Secure patterns for handling secrets across local dev, Docker, and Kubernetes
