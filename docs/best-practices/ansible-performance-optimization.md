# Ansible Performance Optimization Best Practices

**Objective**: Master Ansible performance patterns for enterprise-scale automation. When you need to optimize automation workflows, when you want to reduce execution time and resource usage, when you're building high-performance infrastructureâ€”performance optimization becomes your weapon of choice.

Ansible performance is critical for enterprise automation. Proper optimization enables faster deployments, reduced resource usage, and scalable automation. This guide shows you how to wield performance optimization with the precision of a systems engineer.

## 1) Task Optimization

### Idempotent Task Design

```yaml
# Optimized idempotent tasks
- name: "Install packages efficiently"
  package:
    name: "{{ packages }}"
    state: present
  vars:
    packages:
      - nginx
      - curl
      - wget
      - git
  when: packages is defined

- name: "Configure service efficiently"
  template:
    src: "{{ item.src }}"
    dest: "{{ item.dest }}"
    owner: "{{ item.owner | default('root') }}"
    group: "{{ item.group | default('root') }}"
    mode: "{{ item.mode | default('0644') }}"
  loop: "{{ config_files }}"
  notify: restart service
  when: config_files is defined
```

### Task Batching

```yaml
# Batch similar operations
- name: "Create multiple users"
  user:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    shell: "{{ item.shell | default('/bin/bash') }}"
    home: "{{ item.home | default('/home/' + item.name) }}"
    create_home: "{{ item.create_home | default(true) }}"
  loop: "{{ users }}"
  when: users is defined

- name: "Configure multiple services"
  systemd:
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    enabled: "{{ item.enabled | default(true) }}"
    state: "{{ item.state | default('started') }}"
  loop: "{{ services }}"
  when: services is defined
```

### Conditional Optimization

```yaml
# Optimize conditional execution
- name: "Install development packages"
  package:
    name: "{{ dev_packages }}"
    state: present
  when: 
    - environment == "development"
    - dev_packages is defined
    - dev_packages | length > 0

- name: "Configure production settings"
  template:
    src: production.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/app/production.conf
  when: 
    - environment == "production"
    - production_config is defined
```

**Why Task Optimization Matters**: Proper task optimization enables efficient execution and resource usage. Understanding these patterns prevents performance bottlenecks and enables scalable automation.

## 2) Parallel Execution

### Async Task Patterns

```yaml
# Async task execution
- name: "Long-running operation"
  command: "{{ long_running_command }}"
  async: 300
  poll: 10
  register: long_task
  when: long_running_command is defined

- name: "Wait for async task completion"
  wait_for:
    timeout: 300
  when: long_task is defined
```

### Parallel Host Execution

```yaml
# Parallel host execution
- name: "Configure multiple hosts in parallel"
  template:
    src: config.j2
    dest: "/etc/app/config"
  delegate_to: "{{ item }}"
  loop: "{{ groups['webservers'] }}"
  async: 60
  poll: 0
  when: groups['webservers'] is defined

- name: "Wait for all parallel tasks"
  wait_for:
    timeout: 300
  when: async_tasks is defined
```

### Throttling and Rate Limiting

```yaml
# Throttle concurrent operations
- name: "Resource-intensive operation"
  command: "{{ resource_intensive_command }}"
  throttle: 2
  async: 60
  poll: 0
  when: resource_intensive_command is defined

- name: "Rate-limited API calls"
  uri:
    url: "{{ api_url }}"
    method: POST
    body: "{{ api_data }}"
  throttle: 5
  when: api_url is defined
```

**Why Parallel Execution Matters**: Proper parallel execution enables faster deployments and better resource utilization. Understanding these patterns prevents bottlenecks and enables scalable automation.

## 3) Fact Gathering Optimization

### Selective Fact Gathering

```yaml
# Optimize fact gathering
- name: "Gather only required facts"
  setup:
    gather_subset:
      - "!all"
      - "network"
      - "hardware"
      - "virtual"
  when: gather_facts is defined

- name: "Disable fact gathering for specific tasks"
  command: "{{ command }}"
  gather_facts: false
  when: command is defined
```

### Fact Caching

```yaml
# Enable fact caching
# ansible.cfg
[defaults]
fact_caching = redis
fact_caching_connection = localhost:6379
fact_caching_timeout = 86400

# Use cached facts
- name: "Use cached facts"
  debug:
    msg: "{{ ansible_facts['os_family'] }}"
  when: ansible_facts is defined
```

### Custom Fact Collection

```yaml
# Custom fact collection
- name: "Collect custom facts"
  setup:
    gather_subset: "!all"
    filter: "ansible_*"
  register: custom_facts
  when: custom_facts is defined
```

**Why Fact Gathering Optimization Matters**: Proper fact gathering optimization reduces execution time and resource usage. Understanding these patterns prevents performance bottlenecks and enables efficient automation.

## 4) Network Optimization

### Connection Optimization

```yaml
# SSH connection optimization
# ansible.cfg
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s -o ControlPath=/tmp/ansible-ssh-%h-%p-%r
pipelining = True
control_path = /tmp/ansible-ssh-%h-%p-%r
control_path_dir = /tmp/.ansible-cp
```

### Connection Pooling

```yaml
# Connection pooling configuration
# ansible.cfg
[defaults]
forks = 10
host_key_checking = False
gathering = smart
fact_caching = memory
```

### Network Timeout Optimization

```yaml
# Network timeout optimization
- name: "Set connection timeout"
  uri:
    url: "{{ api_url }}"
    timeout: 30
    retries: 3
  when: api_url is defined

- name: "Set SSH timeout"
  command: "{{ ssh_command }}"
  timeout: 60
  when: ssh_command is defined
```

**Why Network Optimization Matters**: Proper network optimization reduces latency and improves reliability. Understanding these patterns prevents network bottlenecks and enables efficient automation.

  when: memory_optimized_command is defined

- name: "Limit memory usage"
  command: "{{ memory_limited_command }}"
  delegate_to: localhost
  run_once: true
  when: memory_limited_command is defined
```

### CPU Optimization

```yaml
# CPU optimization patterns
- name: "Optimize CPU usage"
  command: "{{ cpu_optimized_command }}"
  throttle: "{{ ansible_processor_vcpus | default(4) }}"
  when: cpu_optimized_command is defined

- name: "Limit CPU usage"
  command: "{{ cpu_limited_command }}"
  delegate_to: localhost
  run_once: true
  when: cpu_limited_command is defined
```

### I/O Optimization

```yaml
# I/O optimization patterns
- name: "Optimize I/O operations"
  copy:
    src: "{{ item.src }}"
    dest: "{{ item.dest }}"
    mode: "{{ item.mode | default('0644') }}"
  loop: "{{ files }}"
  when: files is defined

- name: "Batch I/O operations"
  template:
    src: "{{ item.src }}"
    dest: "{{ item.dest }}"
  loop: "{{ templates }}"
