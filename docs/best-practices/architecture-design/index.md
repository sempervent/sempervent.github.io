# Architecture & Design Best Practices

**Objective**: Master senior-level architecture and design patterns for production systems. When you need to build robust, scalable architectures, when you want to follow proven methodologies, when you need enterprise-grade patternsâ€”these best practices become your weapon of choice.

## System Architecture

- **[Cloud Architecture](cloud-architecture.md)** - Scalable cloud infrastructure patterns with AWS
- **[Secrets Management](secrets-management.md)** - How to manage secrets safely across dev, test, and prod
- **[Testing & CI/CD Pipelines](ci-cd-pipelines.md)** - Keeping code, data, and infrastructure healthy with automated checks
- **[Documentation](documentation.md)** - Writing, organizing, and sustaining useful docs for data + devops projects
- **[Caching & Performance Layers](caching-performance.md)** - How to cache safely across DBs, APIs, tiles, and workflows

## Knowledge Management

- **[RDF/OWL Metadata Automation](rdf-owl-metadata-automation.md)** - Dynamic knowledge graphs with automated ontological associations

## Data Serialization

- **[Protocol Buffers with Python](protobuf-python.md)** - Production-ready data serialization and microservices communication

*These best practices provide the complete machinery for building production-ready architectures. Each guide includes architectural patterns, configuration examples, and real-world implementation strategies for enterprise deployment.*
