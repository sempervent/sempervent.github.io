# Database & Data Management Best Practices

**Objective**: Master senior-level database and data management patterns for production systems. When you need to build robust, scalable data systems, when you want to follow proven methodologies, when you need enterprise-grade patternsâ€”these best practices become your weapon of choice.

## PostgreSQL & High Availability

- **[Patroni PostgreSQL HA](patroni-postgres-ha.md)** - Master PostgreSQL high availability with Patroni
- **[PostgreSQL Connection Pooling](postgres-pooling.md)** - Best practices for PgBouncer and application-level pooling
- **[Database Migrations & Schema Evolution](database-migrations.md)** - How to evolve schemas safely across Postgres, PostGIS, and federated FDWs
- **[Foreign Data Wrappers in Postgres](fdw-postgres.md)** - Safely bridging Postgres with Parquet, DuckDB, and object storage
- **[Database Optimization](database-optimization.md)** - Tuning PostgreSQL and PostGIS for peak performance

## Data Architecture

- **[Data Engineering](data-engineering.md)** - Designing robust ETL pipelines and real-time processing
- **[ETL Pipeline Design](etl-pipeline-design.md)** - Robust, scalable ETL pipelines with Airflow
- **[GeoParquet Data Warehouses](geoparquet-data-warehouses.md)** - Modern geospatial data warehouses with GeoParquet
- **[AWS Serverless Geospatial](aws-serverless-geospatial.md)** - Serverless spatial processing with AWS Lambda
- **[Lakes vs Lakehouses vs Warehouses](lake-vs-lakehouse-vs-warehouse.md)** - Choose the right data architecture with free Docker Compose stacks

## Data Governance & Quality

- **[Data Lake Governance](data-lake-governance.md)** - Master data lake governance for trustworthy, auditable, compliant data at scale
- **[Geospatial Data Engineering](geospatial-data-engineering.md)** - Spatial data management and processing
- **[Geospatial Benchmarking](geospatial-benchmarking.md)** - Master geospatial benchmarking under CPU/GPU stress
