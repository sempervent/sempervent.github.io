# Machine Learning & AI Best Practices

**Objective**: Master senior-level machine learning and AI patterns for production systems. When you need to build robust, scalable ML systems, when you want to follow proven methodologies, when you need enterprise-grade patterns—these best practices become your weapon of choice.

## ML Operations

- **[ONNX Model Optimization](onnx-model-optimization.md)** - Production-ready machine learning deployment with ONNX
- **[MCP + FastAPI Full Stack](mcp-fastapi-stack.md)** - Secure AI tool integration with Model Context Protocol
- **[Embeddings & Vector Databases](embeddings-and-vector-databases.md)** - Production-grade semantic search and RAG systems
- **[Vibe → Agentic LLMs](vibe-to-agentic.md)** - From creative "vibe coding" to heavy prompts and managed, tool-using agents

## Data Science

- **[R Data Exploration](r-data-exploration.md)** - Tidyverse vs data.table for production data analysis
