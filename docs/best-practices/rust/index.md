# Rust Development Best Practices

**Objective**: Master senior-level Rust development patterns for production systems. When you need to build robust, scalable Rust applications, when you want to follow proven methodologies, when you need enterprise-grade patternsâ€”these best practices become your weapon of choice.

## Core Development

- **[Rust Development Environment](rust-dev-environment.md)** - Setting up a high-performance Rust development workflow
- **[Rust Package Development](rust-package-development.md)** - Building and shipping Rust crates with modern tooling
- **[Rust Testing Best Practices](rust-testing-best-practices.md)** - Comprehensive testing strategies for Rust applications
- **[Rust Code Quality](rust-code-quality.md)** - Linting, formatting, and code quality tools
- **[Rust Performance Tuning](rust-performance-tuning.md)** - Profiling, benchmarking, and optimization techniques

## Advanced Rust

- **[Rust Ownership & Borrowing](rust-ownership-borrowing.md)** - Mastering Rust's ownership system and memory safety
- **[Rust Concurrency Patterns](rust-concurrency-patterns.md)** - Threading, async programming, and parallel processing
- **[Rust Error Handling](rust-error-handling.md)** - Result, Option, and error propagation patterns
- **[Rust Generics & Traits](rust-generics-traits.md)** - Advanced type system patterns and trait design
- **[Rust Unsafe Programming](rust-unsafe-programming.md)** - Safe unsafe code and FFI patterns
- **[Rust Memory Management](rust-memory-management.md)** - Understanding Rust's memory model and optimization

## Web Development

- **[Rust Web Services](rust-web-services.md)** - Building scalable web services with Actix, Warp, and Axum
- **[Rust API Design](rust-api-design.md)** - RESTful API design, OpenAPI, and API versioning
- **[Rust Microservices](rust-microservices.md)** - Service architecture, communication, and orchestration
- **[Rust Web Performance](rust-web-performance.md)** - Performance optimization for web applications

## Data & Analytics

- **[Rust Data Processing](rust-data-processing.md)** - ETL workflows, data pipelines, and batch processing
- **[Rust Data Analysis](rust-data-analysis.md)** - Data analysis workflows with Polars and Arrow
- **[Rust Machine Learning](rust-machine-learning.md)** - ML workflows with Candle, SmartCore, and Linfa
- **[Rust Geospatial Development](rust-geospatial-development.md)** - Spatial data analysis with GeoRust ecosystem

## Infrastructure & DevOps

- **[Rust Containerization](rust-containerization.md)** - Docker, multi-stage builds, and container optimization
- **[Rust CI/CD Pipelines](rust-cicd-pipelines.md)** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and automated deployment
- **[Rust Monitoring & Observability](rust-monitoring-observability.md)** - Logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting
- **[Rust Production Deployment](rust-production-deployment.md)** - Deployment strategies, scaling, and reliability

## Database & Storage

- **[Rust Database Patterns](rust-database-patterns.md)** - Diesel, SQLx, and connection pooling
- **[Rust Caching Strategies](rust-caching-strategies.md)** - Redis, Memcached, and application-level caching
- **[Rust Data Storage](rust-data-storage.md)** - File systems, object storage, and data persistence

## Security & Compliance

- **[Rust Security Best Practices](rust-security-best-practices.md)** - Authentication, authorization, and security patterns
