# Python Development Best Practices

**Objective**: Master senior-level Python development patterns for production systems. When you need to build robust, scalable Python applications, when you want to follow proven methodologies, when you need enterprise-grade patternsâ€”these best practices become your weapon of choice.

## Core Python

- **[Python Package Development](python-package.md)** - Modern Python packaging with `uv` and `pyproject.toml`
- **[Typing in Python](typing-in-python.md)** - Master Python's type system for bulletproof code
- **[Python Concurrency](python-threading-and-multiprocessing.md)** - Threads vs processes for production Python applications
- **[Python Async Best Practices](python-async-best-practices.md)** - Write coroutines that don't betray you
- **[Pytest Best Practices](pytest-best-practices.md)** - Coverage, plugins, speed, and CI integration

## Web Development

- **[API Development](api-development.md)** - Building high-performance, geospatial-aware APIs
- **[FastAPI Geospatial](fastapi-geospatial.md)** - High-performance spatial APIs with FastAPI
- **[Web Performance Optimization](web-performance-optimization.md)** - Core Web Vitals, SEO, and accessibility optimization
