# Ansible Security Hardening Best Practices

**Objective**: Master Ansible security patterns for enterprise-grade automation. When you need to secure automation workflows, when you want to protect sensitive data and credentials, when you're building compliant infrastructureâ€”security hardening becomes your weapon of choice.

Ansible security is critical for enterprise automation. Proper security practices prevent credential exposure, ensure compliance, and protect sensitive infrastructure. This guide shows you how to wield security hardening with the precision of a security engineer.

### The Five Commandments

1. **Understand security threats**
   - Credential exposure and data breaches
   - Privilege escalation and unauthorized access
   - Network security and communication encryption
   - Compliance and audit requirements

2. **Master secret management**
   - Ansible Vault encryption and key management
   - External secret management integration
   - Credential rotation and lifecycle management
   - Access control and audit logging

3. **Know your authentication patterns**
   - SSH key management and rotation
   - Certificate-based authentication
   - Multi-factor authentication integration
   - Service account management

4. **Validate everything**
   - Test security configurations and access controls
   - Verify encryption and key management
   - Check compliance and audit requirements
   - Validate network security and communication

5. **Plan for production**
   - Security monitoring and alerting
   - Incident response and forensics
   - Compliance reporting and auditing
   - Security training and awareness

**Why These Principles**: Security hardening requires understanding both Ansible mechanics and security best practices. Understanding these patterns prevents security breaches and enables compliant automation.

## 1) Credential Security

### Ansible Vault Best Practices

```bash
# Create encrypted files
ansible-vault create group_vars/all/secrets.yml
ansible-vault create host_vars/web-prod-01/secrets.yml

# Use strong passwords
ansible-vault create --vault-password-file .vault_pass group_vars/all/secrets.yml

# Rotate vault passwords
ansible-vault rekey group_vars/all/secrets.yml
```

### Vault Organization

```yaml
# group_vars/all/secrets.yml (encrypted)
# Database credentials
database:
  root_password: "{{ vault_db_root_password }}"
  user_password: "{{ vault_db_user_password }}"
  replication_password: "{{ vault_db_replication_password }}"

# SSL certificates
ssl:
  private_key: "{{ vault_ssl_private_key }}"
  certificate: "{{ vault_ssl_certificate }}"
  ca_certificate: "{{ vault_ssl_ca_certificate }}"

# API keys
api_keys:
  monitoring: "{{ vault_monitoring_api_key }}"
  backup: "{{ vault_backup_api_key }}"
  notification: "{{ vault_notification_api_key }}"

# Service accounts
service_accounts:
  ansible_user: "{{ vault_ansible_user }}"
  ansible_password: "{{ vault_ansible_password }}"
```

### External Secret Management

```yaml
# HashiCorp Vault integration
vault:
  url: "https://vault.example.com"
  auth_method: "token"
  token: "{{ vault_token }}"
  secrets_path: "secret/ansible"

# AWS Secrets Manager
aws_secrets:
  region: "us-west-2"
  secrets:
    database_password: "prod/database/password"
    api_key: "prod/api/key"

# Azure Key Vault
azure_keyvault:
  vault_url: "https://vault.vault.azure.net"
  client_id: "{{ azure_client_id }}"
  client_secret: "{{ azure_client_secret }}"
```

**Why Credential Security Matters**: Proper credential management prevents unauthorized access and data breaches. Understanding these patterns prevents security incidents and enables compliant automation.

## 2) Network Security

### SSH Security Configuration

```yaml
# SSH security settings
ssh_security:
  # Disable password authentication
  password_authentication: "no"
  
  # Use key-based authentication
  pubkey_authentication: "yes"
  
  # Disable root login
  permit_root_login: "no"
  
  # Use specific users
  allowed_users: "ansible,admin"
  
  # Disable X11 forwarding
  x11_forwarding: "no"
  
  # Use strong ciphers
  ciphers: "chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com"
  
  # Use strong MACs
  macs: "hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com"
  
  # Use strong key exchange
  kex_algorithms: "curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org"
```

### SSL/TLS Configuration

```yaml

  # Allow SSH
  ssh_port: 22
  ssh_source: "10.0.0.0/8"
  
  # Allow HTTP/HTTPS
  http_port: 80
  https_port: 443
  
  # Allow specific services
  allowed_services:
    - port: 22
      protocol: "tcp"
      source: "10.0.0.0/8"
    - port: 80
      protocol: "tcp"
      source: "0.0.0.0/0"
    - port: 443
      protocol: "tcp"
      source: "0.0.0.0/0"
```

**Why Network Security Matters**: Proper network security prevents unauthorized access and protects communication. Understanding these patterns prevents network attacks and enables secure automation.

## 3) Access Control

### User Management

    create_home: true
    groups: ["sudo", "ansible"]
    ssh_key: "{{ ansible_ssh_public_key }}"
  
  # Disable root login
  root_login: false
  
  # Remove default users
  remove_users:
    - "ubuntu"
    - "ec2-user"
    - "centos"
  
  # Set password policies
  password_policies:
    min_length: 12
    complexity: true
    history: 5
    max_age: 90

      mode: "0640"
      owner: "root"
      group: "shadow"
    - path: "/etc/passwd"
      mode: "0644"
      owner: "root"
      group: "root"
    - path: "/etc/ssh/sshd_config"
      mode: "0600"
      owner: "root"
      group: "root"
  
  # Secure Ansible files
  ansible_files:
    - path: "{{ ansible_config_dir }}"
      mode: "0755"
      owner: "ansible"
      group: "ansible"
    - path: "{{ ansible_playbook_dir }}"
      mode: "0755"
      owner: "ansible"
      group: "ansible"
```

**Why Access Control Matters**: Proper access control prevents unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Understanding these patterns prevents security breaches and enables compliant automation.

## 4) Audit and Compliance

  authentication: "Strong authentication with multi-factor"
  authorization: "Least privilege with role-based access"
  monitoring: "Continuous monitoring with automated response"
  compliance: "Regular audits with automated validation"
```

**Why This Quickstart**: These patterns cover 90% of security hardening needs. Master these before exploring advanced features.

## 9) The Machine's Summary

Ansible security hardening requires understanding both automation patterns and security best practices. When used correctly, security hardening enables secure, compliant automation that can handle enterprise requirements. The key is understanding threat models, mastering secret management, and following security best practices.

**The Dark Truth**: Without proper security understanding, your automation is vulnerable and non-compliant. Security is your weapon. Use it wisely.

**The Machine's Mantra**: "In security we trust, in secrets we encrypt, and in the hardening we find the path to secure automation."

**Why This Matters**: Security hardening enables secure infrastructure automation that can handle enterprise workloads, maintain compliance, and provide reliable automation while ensuring security and regulatory adherence.
