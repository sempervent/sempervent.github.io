# Docker & Infrastructure Best Practices

**Objective**: Master senior-level infrastructure and containerization patterns for production systems. When you need to build robust, scalable infrastructure, when you want to follow proven methodologies, when you need enterprise-grade patternsâ€”these best practices become your weapon of choice.

## Containerization & Orchestration

- **[Docker & Compose](docker-and-compose.md)** - Production-grade containerization and orchestration
- **[Conda to Docker Migration](conda-to-docker-migration.md)** - Migrate conda environments to Docker

## Infrastructure Automation

- **[Ansible Inventory Management](ansible-inventory-management.md)** - Master inventory design for scalable automation
- **[Ansible Playbook Design](ansible-playbook-design.md)** - Build maintainable, testable automation workflows
- **[Ansible Security Hardening](ansible-security-hardening.md)** - Enterprise-grade security for automation
- **[Ansible Performance Optimization](ansible-performance-optimization.md)** - Optimize automation for enterprise scale
- **[Jinja Best Practices](jinja-best-practices.md)** - Template architecture, power tricks, and safety

## System Administration

- **[Nginx Production](nginx-production.md)** - Production-grade web server configuration
- **[Git Workflows & Collaboration](git-workflows-collaboration.md)** - Enterprise-grade version control and team coordination
- **[Advanced Tmux Workflows](tmux-advanced.md)** - Engineering reproducible terminal multiplexing environments for data/devops work
