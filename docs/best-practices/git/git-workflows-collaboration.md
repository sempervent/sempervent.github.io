## 1) Branching Strategies

### Git Flow (Enterprise Standard)

```bash
# Main branches
main                    # Production-ready code
develop                 # Integration branch for features
release/v1.2.0          # Release preparation
hotfix/critical-bug     # Emergency fixes

# Feature branches
feature/user-auth       # New features
feature/payment-system  # Large features
feature/api-v2          # API improvements
```

**Why Git Flow Matters**: Structured branching enables parallel development while maintaining stability. Understanding these patterns prevents merge conflicts and enables predictable releases.

### GitHub Flow (Continuous Deployment)

```bash
# Simplified workflow
main                    # Always deployable
feature/user-dashboard  # Feature branches
feature/api-endpoints   # Short-lived branches
bugfix/login-issue      # Bug fixes
```

**Why GitHub Flow Matters**: Simplified branching enables faster iteration and continuous deployment. Understanding these patterns prevents branch proliferation and enables rapid development.

### GitLab Flow (Environment-based)

```bash
# Environment-based branching
main                    # Production
staging                 # Pre-production testing
feature/user-auth       # Feature development
hotfix/security-patch   # Emergency fixes
```

**Why GitLab Flow Matters**: Environment-based branching enables controlled deployments and testing. Understanding these patterns prevents production issues and enables safe releases.

## 2) Feature Development Workflow

### Branch Creation and Development

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication

# Development cycle
git add .
git commit -m "Add user login functionality"
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# Keep feature branch updated
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/user-authentication
git rebase main
```

**Why Feature Workflows Matter**: Proper feature development prevents integration issues and maintains code quality. Understanding these patterns prevents merge conflicts and enables smooth collaboration.

### Code Review Process

```bash
# Create pull request
gh pr create --title "Add user authentication" \
  --body "Implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control" \
  --assignee @me \
  --reviewer @team-lead

# Address review feedback
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback: improve error handling"
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# Merge after approval
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

**Why Code Review Matters**: Peer review prevents bugs and improves code quality. Understanding these patterns prevents production issues and enables knowledge sharing.

## 3) Merge Strategies

### Merge Commits (Preserve History)

```bash
# Merge feature branch
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-authentication --no-ff
git push origin main

# Result: Preserves branch history and context
```

**Why Merge Commits Matter**: Preserving history enables better debugging and rollback capabilities. Understanding these patterns prevents information loss and enables better project tracking.

### Rebase and Squash (Clean History)

```bash
# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git checkout feature/user-authentication
git rebase -i main

# Squash commits for clean history
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-authentication --squash
git commit -m "Add user authentication system"
git push origin main
```

**Why Rebase Matters**: Clean history improves readability and debugging. Understanding these patterns prevents commit pollution and enables better project navigation.

### Fast-Forward Merges (Linear History)

```bash
# Fast-forward merge
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-authentication --ff-only
git push origin main

# Result: Linear history without merge commits
```

**Why Fast-Forward Matters**: Linear history simplifies project navigation and reduces complexity. Understanding these patterns prevents history pollution and enables cleaner project structure.

## 4) Release Management

### Semantic Versioning

```bash
# Version tagging
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0: Add user authentication"
git push origin v1.2.0

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
git push origin release/v1.2.0
```

**Why Versioning Matters**: Proper versioning enables predictable releases and dependency management. Understanding these patterns prevents version conflicts and enables better project coordination.

### Release Preparation

```bash
# Update version numbers
git checkout release/v1.2.0
# Update package.json, setup.py, etc.
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"
git push origin release/v1.2.0

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin main --tags
```

**Why Release Preparation Matters**: Systematic release preparation prevents deployment issues and ensures consistency. Understanding these patterns prevents production problems and enables reliable releases.

### Hotfix Workflow

```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch
# Fix critical issue
git add .
git commit -m "Fix security vulnerability in authentication"
git push origin hotfix/security-patch

# Merge to main and develop
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/security-patch
git tag v1.2.1
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/security-patch
```

**Why Hotfix Workflows Matter**: Emergency fixes require immediate attention and careful coordination. Understanding these patterns prevents security issues and enables rapid response.

## 5) Collaboration Patterns

### Team Coordination

```bash
# Daily standup workflow
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/daily-task
# Work on task
git add .
git commit -m "Complete daily task: implement user validation"
git push origin feature/daily-task
# Create PR for review
```

**Why Team Coordination Matters**: Proper coordination prevents conflicts and improves productivity. Understanding these patterns prevents duplicate work and enables efficient collaboration.

### Code Review Standards

```bash
# Review checklist
# 1. Code quality and style
# 2. Test coverage and functionality

git add .
git rebase --continue
git push origin feature/user-auth --force-with-lease
```

**Why Conflict Resolution Matters**: Proper conflict handling prevents data loss and maintains code integrity. Understanding these patterns prevents merge disasters and enables smooth collaboration.

## 6) Automation and CI/CD

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Configure .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 4.0.1
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v0.950
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
```

**Why Pre-commit Hooks Matter**: Automated quality checks prevent issues before they reach the repository. Understanding these patterns prevents quality degradation and enables consistent code standards.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest tests/ --cov=src/
      - name: Run linting
        run: |
          flake8 src/
          black --check src/
      - name: Security scan
        run: |
          bandit -r src/
```

**Why CI/CD Matters**: Automated testing and deployment prevent issues and improve reliability. Understanding these patterns prevents production problems and enables continuous delivery.

### Branch Protection Rules

```yaml
# Branch protection configuration
main:
  required_status_checks:
    strict: true
    contexts:
      - "test"
      - "lint"
      - "security-scan"
  enforce_admins: true
  required_pull_request_reviews:
    required_approving_review_count: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
  restrictions:
    users: []
    teams: ["senior-developers"]
```

**Why Branch Protection Matters**: Protected branches prevent direct commits and ensure quality gates. Understanding these patterns prevents unauthorized changes and enables controlled development.

## 7) Advanced Patterns

### Submodule Management

```bash
# Add submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/company/shared-lib.git libs/shared-lib
git commit -m "Add shared library submodule"
git push origin main

# Update submodule
git submodule update --remote
git add libs/shared-lib
git commit -m "Update shared library to v2.1.0"
```

**Why Submodules Matter**: Shared code requires careful version management. Understanding these patterns prevents dependency conflicts and enables code reuse.

### Large File Handling

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Configure Git LFS for large files"
```

**Why LFS Matters**: Large files can bloat repositories and slow down operations. Understanding these patterns prevents repository bloat and enables efficient version control.

### Worktree for Parallel Development

```bash
# Create worktree for parallel work
git worktree add ../project-hotfix main
cd ../project-hotfix
# Work on hotfix without switching branches
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical bug"
git push origin main
```

**Why Worktrees Matter**: Parallel development requires multiple working directories. Understanding these patterns prevents context switching and enables efficient multitasking.

## 8) Security and Access Control

### SSH Key Management

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Add to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**Why SSH Security Matters**: Secure authentication prevents unauthorized access. Understanding these patterns prevents security breaches and enables safe collaboration.

### GPG Signing

```bash
# Configure GPG signing
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Sign commits
git commit -S -m "Add user authentication with signed commit"
```

**Why GPG Signing Matters**: Signed commits verify authorship and prevent tampering. Understanding these patterns prevents identity spoofing and enables trust verification.

### Access Control

```bash
# Repository permissions
# - Read: All team members
# - Write: Senior developers
# - Admin: Project leads
# - Maintain: Code owners

# Branch permissions
# - main: Senior developers only
# - develop: All developers
# - feature/*: Individual developers
```

**Why Access Control Matters**: Proper permissions prevent unauthorized changes and maintain security. Understanding these patterns prevents security breaches and enables controlled development.

## 9) Performance Optimization

### Repository Maintenance

```bash
# Clean up repository
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
git repack -ad
git prune

# Remove large files from history
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f large-file.zip' HEAD
```

**Why Repository Maintenance Matters**: Regular maintenance prevents repository bloat and improves performance. Understanding these patterns prevents performance degradation and enables efficient operations.

### Shallow Clones

```bash
# Shallow clone for CI/CD
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/company/project.git
git fetch --unshallow  # When full history needed
```

**Why Shallow Clones Matter**: Reduced clone size improves CI/CD performance. Understanding these patterns prevents slow builds and enables efficient automation.

### Partial Clones

```bash
# Partial clone for large repositories
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/company/large-project.git
git config --global filter.lfs.process "git-lfs filter-process"
```

**Why Partial Clones Matter**: Selective cloning reduces bandwidth and storage requirements. Understanding these patterns prevents resource waste and enables efficient development.

## 10) Troubleshooting and Recovery

### Common Issues

```bash
# Recover from bad merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force-with-lease

# Recover from rebase disaster
git reflog
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}

# Recover deleted branch
git reflog --all
git checkout -b recovered-branch HEAD@{3}
```

**Why Troubleshooting Matters**: Git operations can go wrong and require recovery. Understanding these patterns prevents data loss and enables quick problem resolution.

### Backup Strategies

```bash
# Mirror repository
git clone --mirror https://github.com/company/project.git
git remote set-url --push origin https://backup-server.com/project.git
git push --mirror

# Regular backups
git bundle create backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).bundle --all
```

**Why Backup Strategies Matter**: Repository loss can be catastrophic for projects. Understanding these patterns prevents data loss and enables disaster recovery.

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Diagnose slow operations
git config --global core.preloadindex true
git config --global core.fscache true
git config --global gc.auto 256

# Profile Git operations
GIT_TRACE=1 git status
GIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE=1 git checkout main
```

**Why Performance Matters**: Slow Git operations can impact productivity. Understanding these patterns prevents performance bottlenecks and enables efficient development.
